    "Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. It is characterized by sudden seizures that can be life-threatening. EEG (Electroencephalography) is commonly used to diagnose epilepsy by monitoring brain activity. However, EEG recordings require expert analysis, making the process slow and tedious.\n",

Instead of analyzing the entire EEG signal at once (which can be noisy), Welch’s Method breaks the signal into smaller overlapping segments. For each segment, it calculates a power estimate, then averages all these estimates together. This reduces noise and gives a smoother and more reliable PSD result."
